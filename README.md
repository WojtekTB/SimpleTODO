# Simple TODO App
Hope is to build a simple TODO app to encourage myself to learn a couple things:
- Finally build something from scratch using react
- Learn to make websites adapt to mobile
- Re-familiarize myself with SQL (or SQLite?) and better understand how its ins and outs work
- Better GoLang along the way for the backend and understand what makes back-end work different

I would also like to manage this project with PR's, github issues, and other production like actions to show future employers that I am at least capable of that.
