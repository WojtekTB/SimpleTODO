# Simple TODO App
Hope is to build a simple TODO app to encourage myself to learn a couple things:
- Finally build something from scratch using react
- Learn to make websites adapt to mobile
- Re-familiarize myself with SQL (or SQLite?) and better understand how its ins and outs work
- Better GoLang along the way for the backend and understand what makes back-end work different

I would also like to manage this project with PR's, github issues, and other production like actions to show future employers that I am at least capable of that.

### Next.js
As it turns out, the recent framework that became popular is Next.js. As I understand it generaly provides a lot of nice features for developers, and is becoming pretty popular nowadays so it is probably worth learning about. And so I am initializing the project using it.

I will be referring to [this](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app) tutorial provided by Next.js itself while building the app.

### Page and App Routing
Looks like in Next.js you can route the url to be `<your url>/some_path` by placing a `some_path.jsx` in a `/pages` dierctory at the root. This is page routing.

App routing is instead having an app page be the root by default. In my case it is `/src/app/page.tsx`.
